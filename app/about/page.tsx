          I like to play bass guitar as a hobby. My favorite way to practice is
          to play songs. I always wished I had a tool that would do a few things
          to help me practice:
        </p>
        <ul className="my-6 mx-6 md:mx-12 list-disc">
          <li>List all of the songs I want to practice in 1 place</li>
          <li>Show notes/tips about how to play each song, including tuning</li>
          <li>
            Embed YouTube videos of covers, live performances, isolated tracks,
            etc. for each song
          </li>
          <li>
            Allow me to easily adjust the playback rate. YouTube already lets
            you adjust the playback rate, but I wanted something with fewer
            clicks
          </li>
          <li>
            Allow me to specify a custom loop so I can repeatedly practice a
            specific section of a song
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>{`Bass'd on that wishlist, I made this site!`}</p>
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}
