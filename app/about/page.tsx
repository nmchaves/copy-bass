          I like to play bass guitar as a hobby. My favorite way to practice is
          to play songs. I always wished I had a tool that would do a few things
          to help me practice:
        </p>
        <ul className="my-6 mx-6 md:mx-12 list-disc">
          <li>List all of the songs I want to practice in 1 place</li>
          <li>Show notes/tips about how to play each song, including tuning</li>
          <li>
            Embed videos of covers, live performances, isolated tracks, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Allow me to easily adjust the playback rate. YouTube already lets
            users adjust the playback rate, but I wanted something with fewer
            clicks
          </li>
          <li>
            Allow me to specify a custom loop so I can repeatedly practice a
            specific section of a song
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-6">
          <span className="font-bold">Bass</span>&apos;d on that wishlist, I
          made this site!

          The favicon is based on a{" "}

          ...but of course, I <em>had</em> to rotate it since I&apos;m
          left-handed.
